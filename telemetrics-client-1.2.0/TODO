Build
=====
- sort out libtool versioning so that shared library version is correct

Probes
======
- add pstore probe (Archana)
- journal probe: detect kernel oopses (Patrick)
- crash probe: add function/register value info to crash payloads (Patrick)
- crash probe: if some symbols are missing from backtraces, attempt the
  debuginfo lookup again after a certain timeout (Patrick)
- crash probe: ensure core file is opened with O_EXCL (Patrick)
- crash probe: set umask so that core file is created with 0600 permissions (Patrick)
- crash probe: use setgid() and setuid(), since we don't distinguish between
  real/effective/saved IDs or need to restore privileges later. (Patrick)
- crash probe: for non-debug builds, ensure that we are invoked by the kernel by
  checking for a "0" return value from getppid(), and write tests to verify that
  attempts to run the crash probe for non-debug builds fail. (Patrick)

Library
=======
- add API for structured payloads

Other
=====
- set fixed size for system-wide core file ulimit, and afterward notify QA team
  to update the BAT test that checks for the ulimit value.
