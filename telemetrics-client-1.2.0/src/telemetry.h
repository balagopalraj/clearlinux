/** @file telemetry.h
 * Public API header file for telemetrics-client
 *
 * @mainpage
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 *
 * This package provides the front end component of a complete telemetrics
 * solution for Linux-based operating systems. Specifically, the front end
 * component includes:
 *
 * - telemetrics probes that collect specific types of data from the operating
 *   system.
 *
 * - a library, libtelemetry, that telemetrics probes use to create telemetrics
 *   records and send them to the daemon for further processing.
 *
 * - a daemon, telemd, that prepares the records to send to a telemetrics server
 *   (not included in this source tree), or spools the records on disk in case
 *   it's unable to successfully deliver them.
 *
 * @section public_api Public API
 *
 * API documentation is included in @link telemetry.h @endlink.
