ister is a template based installer for linux

See the ister-design for information regarding how ister will work and what the
template format supported is.

Currently ister is in heavy development and is missing most features.

Ister aims to be pylint and pep8 clean. New code should verify both pass without
exception before being submitted. If a new exception makes sense it can be added
on a case by case basis.

Testing is supported through ister_test.py.
