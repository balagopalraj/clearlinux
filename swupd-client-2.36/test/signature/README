Crypto signing/verifying test stuff.

Test code to demonstrate that we know how to sign and verify data
using the scheme that the crypto experts have come up with. To build
on your typical linux dev machine:

    cd ../..
    make sig_verify_test

To generate some random data and sign it:

    cd test/signature
    ./sign.sh

To verify the signed data using an openssl command:

    ./verify.sh

To do the same verification using code written in C:

    ../../sig_verify_test my-data my-data.signed ca.cert.pem
