       whitespace.
     * dwarf.h: Blank line added accidentally.
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Remove trailing whitespace. Fix indent.
     * dwarf_leb.c: Remove trailing whitespace. Fix indent.

        dwarf_error.c,dwarf_error.h,dwarf_form.c,dwarf_init_finish.c,
        dwarf_leb.c,dwarf_query.c,pro_section.c: Fixed indents and
        removed trailing whitespace.
2015-01-06  David Anderson
     * dwarf_frame.c( _dwarf_get_fde_info_for_a_pc_row): Cast
       the pointer returned from _dwarf_get_alloc(), somehow
       this cast was omitted.
     * dwarf_alloc.c(dwarf_dealloc): Ensure a NULL
       'space' pointer input is not touched before checking
       if it is set.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c(_dwarf_setup): For badly formed Elf
       ensure we do not use stale pointers.
2015-01-05  David Anderson
     * dwarf_original_elf_init.c(dwarf_finish): If the Dwarf_Debug is
       not initialized do not use it.
2015-01-03  David Anderson
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Somehow dwarf_transform_to_disk_form()
       was not documented. Now it is.
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated, version 1.38.
2015-01-03  David Anderson
     * dwarf_allo.c: Comment the allocation table base
       more carefully.
     * dwarf_base_types.h: Making DW_DLA defines more
       readable, more consistent with other instances.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Adding producer error codes.
       The producer library has some places error values
       are misidentified. Main effect: documentation.
     * dwarf_error.c:  Add the strings for the new error codes.

     *	A new year begins.
